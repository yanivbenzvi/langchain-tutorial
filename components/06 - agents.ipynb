    "## Agents 🤖🤖\n",
    "\n",
    "Official LangChain Documentation describes agents perfectly (emphasis mine):\n",
    "> Some applications will require not just a predetermined chain of calls to LLMs/other tools, but potentially an **unknown chain** that depends on the user's input. In these types of chains, there is a “agent” which has access to a suite of tools. Depending on the user input, the agent can then **decide which, if any, of these tools to call**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically you use the LLM not just for text output, but also for decision making. The coolness and power of this functionality can't be overstated enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam Altman emphasizes that the LLMs are good '[reasoning engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Guz73e6fw&t=867s)'. Agent take advantage of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are individual components designed to perform specific tasks, such as retrieving information from external sources or processing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are functions an agent can invoke. The `Tool` abstraction includes:\n",
    "- Input schema: Informs the language model of the required parameters.\n",
    "- Function to run: Typically a Python function to be invoked."
